![looklike](https://github.com/ChenSiLiang/RotatePhotoView/blob/master/screenshot/viewpager.gif)

#Set Up
##Gradle
	compile "com.chensl.rotatephotoview:rotatephotoview:1.0.3"

and don't forget to add jcenter() to repositories

#Usage
##in code
you need to enable rotation, by default it's **false**.

	PhotoViewAttacher attacher = new PhotoViewAttacher(mImageView);
	attacher.setRotatable(true);

set rotate listener

	photoView.setOnViewRotateListener(new PhotoViewAttacher.OnViewRotateListener() {
        @Override
        public void onRotate(int degree) {
             //do something
        }
    });

enable recover to `Right Angle`(0,90,180,270),by default it's **false**.

    mAttacher.setToRightAngle(true);

other functions just as `PhotoView`.



don't forget to **clear** when leave,for example.

	@Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        attacher.cleanup();
        super.onDestroy();
    }
##in xml
	 <uk.co.senab.photoview.PhotoView
        android:id="@+id/photoview"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

#With Volley
let the `PhotoView` extends `Volley.NetworkImageView` instead of `ImageView`.

#Waring
Catch `IllegalArgumentException` when working with `ViewPager`,see `HackyViewPager` for more details.
